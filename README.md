# Irrigation-System
A fuzzy logic-based smart irrigation system that calculates the recommended water amount based on soil moisture and rainfall levels. Built using Python, scikit-fuzzy, and Matplotlib.

This project implements a **Fuzzy Logic-based Irrigation System** using **Python** and **scikit-fuzzy**.  
It calculates the **recommended water amount** for irrigation based on:  
✔ **Soil Moisture Level**  
✔ **Rainfall Percentage**  

## 🚀 Features  
- Uses **fuzzy logic** to make smart irrigation decisions.  
- Implements **Triangular Membership Functions** for inputs & output.  
- Defines **9 fuzzy rules** to determine optimal water usage.  
- **Plots membership functions** for soil moisture, rainfall, and water amount.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **scikit-fuzzy (skfuzzy)**
